    "We begin with a simple plot to give us a starting point and validate that our simulation is giving sensible results. We would expect that significantly below the critical value, all of the percolation clusters in our simulation would terminate, whilst significantly above the critical value there would be one single cluster which dominates, and does not terminate. A simple plot of log cluster size against log number of clusters over a range of probabilities shows this clearly."
